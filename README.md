This is a simple Binary Search Tree (BST) implementation in Java. It includes basic operations like inserting and searching for nodes in the tree, as well as different ways to traverse the tree, such as Preorder, Inorder, and Postorder. Additionally, it has some extra features, like counting the number of nodes and calculating the height of the tree. This project is mainly for learning how BSTs work and can be a good base if you want to dive into more advanced tree structures later.
